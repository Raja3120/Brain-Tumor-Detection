The Brain Tumor Detection project is an advanced application of machine learning and image processing techniques designed to identify and classify brain tumors from medical imaging data. Utilizing datasets of MRI scans, the project employs algorithms such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze and differentiate between benign and malignant tumors. The system preprocesses the images, extracts relevant features, and trains a model to accurately detect and classify tumors based on their characteristics. By providing an automated, high-accuracy diagnostic tool, this project aims to assist radiologists and medical professionals in early tumor detection, improving patient outcomes and treatment planning. The user-friendly interface allows for easy input and interpretation of scan data, facilitating efficient and reliable diagnostic support in clinical settings.
